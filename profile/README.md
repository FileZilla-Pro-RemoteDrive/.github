## üöÄ Overview

FileZilla Pro RemoteDrive lets you mount remote storage services within Finder as if they were local disks. Whether your files are on FTP, SFTP, cloud providers like Google Drive, Amazon S3, or OneDrive, RemoteDrive makes them available through the standard Finder interface. You open, edit, move, copy, rename ‚Äî all as though they were stored on your Mac.

You no longer need to manually download a file just to edit, then reupload it. RemoteDrive handles that seamlessly by downloading only what you need, on demand, and keeping everything else in the cloud. This saves space on your local drive, reduces wait times, and simplifies your workflow.

On top of that, RemoteDrive supports a wide range of protocols and cloud services. It integrates deeply with macOS using Apple‚Äôs File Provider framework. It includes features like drag-and-drop between local and remote, automatic reconnecting to servers, managing multiple connections, and configuring settings such as TLS certificate validation, password storage, and startup behavior.  

It‚Äôs ideal for developers, content creators, sysadmins, and anyone who works with remote files frequently ‚Äî especially where switching between remote storage and local tools is slowing things down or causing friction.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About

RemoteDrive is developed by FileZilla Pro (Business Follows srl) to bridge the gap between cloud/remote file storage and local usability. Many users of FTP/SFTP, S3, WebDAV, and other cloud services struggle with workflows that require constant file transfers. RemoteDrive addresses this by letting those remote locations behave like mounted drives, eliminating many manual steps.

Users can configure servers or cloud accounts from a menu, connect/disconnect them easily, and interact with remote files via Finder just like they would with external HDDs or shared drives. The app includes a 7-day free trial after which a yearly subscription is required.  

General settings let you control how RemoteDrive behaves: whether to reconnect to servers at launch; whether to store passwords; whether to show log details; how drag-and-drop operations work; startup settings; and so on. Security is a priority: TLS/SSL is supported, certificates can be validated through Keychain, and your data remains encrypted over the wire.

Because the app uses cloud or remote storage, performance depends on your network and the service used. But for many use-cases, this gives near-instant access to files without the overhead of constant downloads and uploads.
